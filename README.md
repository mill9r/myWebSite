# myWebSite
This is a website, that collect data from students and generate a teachers ranking. 
There are two roles: admin and user. 
Admin can add information about teachers and students. 
Users estimate universities subjects and the rank is based on this data. 
For this project I used Bootstrap, Spring mvc, Spring Security, Hibernate and JSP.
